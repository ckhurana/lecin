									<h3>Balwadi - Early Childhood Literacy Program</h3>
									<p>It has been observed that, children enrolled for at least one year of pre-school are more likely to develop the critical skills they need to succeed in higher grades and less likely to drop out or repeat the classes. After working with children of primary and secondary school for nearly 5 years, our team realised that there is a dire need to develop early literacy and language skills in children from an early age so that they acquire adequate skills and abilities that all children need before entering into primary schools. Formulating a plan for this problem, team LECIN set up its first Balwadi in Okhla, Delhi in April 2019. The main objective of the early childhood literacy program is to facilitate optimum development of the child’s full potential and lay the foundation for all round development and lifelong learning.</p>
									<p>We believe that every child is unique, having skills and abilities which should always be enhanced. Respecting the different pace of development of all students, we ensure the physical, mental, emotional and social growth of each.</p>
									<p>
									The program predominantly focuses on the following aspects of child development:
									<ol>
										<li>Sensory and Perceptual development
										<li>Physical, Health and Motor Development
										<li>Language Development
										<li>Cognitive Development
										<li>Development of creative and aesthetic appreciation
										<li>Personal, Social and Emotional development
									</ol>
									</p>

									<h3>Children’s library</h3>
									<p>We live in a community where reading is not much appreciated because of the lack of exposure towards the budding age of children. Whereas, we at LECIN have always encouraged children to read and try to inculcate a habit in them. For the same, we have set up a small children’s library in our Balwadi centre where they can peacefully enjoy their reading sessions. The idea is to provide them a kind of exposure where they can engage into some meaningful activities. To promote such habits we conduct regular activities such as shared reading & writing, read aloud and storytelling. This not only helps us improve their reading skill but also has been a great practice in increasing confidence in kids. We keep updating the books in stock from time to time so that we can provide maximum exposure to children.</p>
									
									<h3>Healthy Sunday</h3>
									<p>We celebrate Healthy Sundays in community school, where nourishing food and beverages are distributed among children to promote healthy eating habits. Children enjoy being a part of this program and eagerly wait for a glass of Mosambi juice, a bowl of fruits or something else each Sunday.</p>
