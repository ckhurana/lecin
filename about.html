									<p>Development in India can only be ushered if the next generations of the country, its children grow into educated, independent and conscientious individuals. Let’s Educate Children In Need (LECIN), a youth led non-profit organization thus, strives to make a difference in the lives of those young ones, who come from the marginalized communities. They form a major part of our population which do not have access to proper resources like quality education. Our academic programs, together with extra-curricular ones, aim to make a positive contribution to every child’s long-term growth, by facilitating a stimulating and enabling learning environment.</p>
									<p>We strongly believe that, to bring a change in the society, communities as well as individuals must come together and contribute equally. LECIN focuses on quality, integrity and teamwork, with a goal to make a difference through holistic development</p>
